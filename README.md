## Why not Chroma Connect?

While Razer's Chroma is by far the most prolific RGB SDK in games, and Chroma Connect does sound good on paper — allowing third-party hardware to be supported by Chroma-enabled games — the truth is that, e.g. for keyboards, they crush the 132 points of data down to just 5. Yeah, five. That's barely good enough for static effects; so you can forget intricate patterns or animations if you're not using a Razer keyboard.

## Getting Started

Simply download the executable from [the latest release](https://github.com/Sainan/universal-rgb/releases) and run it. It should "just work", but you can monitor and manage it at http://localhost:59084/.

Additionally, you can drop the universal-rgb.exe into `%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup` to have it start automatically.
